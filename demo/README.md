# Rust 101 â€” Learn Rust

This is a collection of small projects that were used in a lecture to teach Rust.

## RAT

Partial implementation of cat in Rust, focussed on showing a first Rust project, and continued learning of Rust and its concepts.

```
rat [-n] [file ...]
```

See `man cat` on what the options do.

## Prologue

[Rust][rust] is a modern systems programming language with safety in mind as one of its core goals and strengths. Systems programming is programming within a resource constrained environment. However, as a lot of our services run now in paid-for-usage cloud environments, we can also consider them as resource constrained environments. This is why Rust is a great fit for more use cases than people might realize.

As it is a modern language and has taken the lessons from many other languages before it, it is also surprisingly pleasant to use once you get the hang of it. Its type system also allows expressive code that can help you exclude a great categories of bugs beyond the benefits that static typing can bring.

The goal of this guide is to introduce Rust to you as an individual or an entire organization. Should this not be sufficient you can also contact me for 1-on-1 coaching or workshops for your organization, by emailing me at [glen@plabayo.tech](mailto:glen@plabayo.tech). More information on Glen can be found at <https://glendc.com/>.

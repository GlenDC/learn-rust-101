## Prologue

[Rust][rust], a modern systems programming language, prioritizes safety as a core attribute. Systems programming typically operates within resource-limited environments, much like our services running in pay-per-use cloud settings. This makes Rust highly suitable for more scenarios than one might initially consider.

As a contemporary language, Rust has learned from its predecessors, making it enjoyable to use once you've mastered its nuances. Its type system facilitates expressive coding, helping to eliminate a wide range of bugs beyond the advantages of static typing.

This guide aims to familiarize both individuals and organizations with Rust. If you need further assistance, I offer 1-on-1 coaching and organizational workshops.

## Rust 101 Course

The origins of this guide can be found in the preparation of a semester long course I gave to a group of employees at [OTA Insight Ltd.](https://www.otainsight.com/). The recordings of this course are available on YouTube at: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQgXEsLXFxpVyLddG8FFXfNQEiodTzAjj>. The videos are however not of the highest quality, especially given the many better resources out there.

## Learning Rust

Becoming proficient in Rust requires the fulfillment of three pillars:

- Pillar I: Learn Rust and get your foundations right
  - [Learn Rust](/guide/learn-rust/index.html)
  - [Learn More Rust](/guide/learn-more-rust/index.html)
  - [Learn Async Rust](/guide/learn-async-rust/index.html)
  - [Study using the "Rust for Rustaceans: Idiomatic Programming for Experienced Developers" book](/guide/study-using-the-rust-for-rustaceans-idiomatic-programming-for-experienced-developers-book.md)
- Pillar II: Develop with Rust (Practical Experience)
  - [Study using the "Zero to Production in Rust" book](/guide/study-using-the-zero-to-production-in-rust-book.md)
  - [Contribute for the first time to an existing project](/guide/contribute-for-the-first-time-to-an-existing-project.md)
  - [Contribute an advanced feature to an existing project or start a project from scratch](/guide/contribute-an-advanced-feature-to-an-existing-project-or-start-a-project-from-scratch.md)
- Pillar III: Be part of the Rust Ecosystem:
  - [Next Steps](/guide/next-steps.md)

What steps of each pillar you do is not of too much problem, do whatever feels best for you.
You can of course complete all steps, and do them in the order as given, but most likely
you probably want to use this learning guide more as a reference and for inspiration,
rather then to follow it word by word.

The above paths are just a suggestion and also should make clear that there are many ways and approaches to using this guide.
Most important is that you do enjoy the journey and that you learn consistently (e.g. ~ X hours per week). How you'll walk the path and how often you revisit things will depend on your learning style and capabilities. There are however no wrong ways to go. E.g. maybe you want to dive into some code yourself as soon as possible and only then will start covering foundations. Or perhaps you first wanna feel very comfortable to only then start really coding yourself once you think you understand the foundations well. All up to you really.

Only thing I would really want to hammer on is to do a lot of coding yourself. The best way to learn is to do. So don't be afraid to make mistakes and to try things out. You'll learn a lot more that way. It will be a very confronting journey but it will be worth it. If all you do is read and read you'll never really get a feel for the language and you'll never really get a feel for what you can do with it. So please, do a lot of coding yourself. Plus at times we can trick our brain into thinking we understand something when we don't.

Also even if you start to reach advanced topics (e.g. Rust for Rustaceans), it is still very important to keep doing the basics. You'll be surprised how quickly you can forget things. So keep doing the basics and keep doing the advanced topics. It is a never ending journey.

You'll notice when reading this guide that there are often alternatives mentioned or several layers of difficulty. With this in mind it might very well be your choice to go through a section shallow to start, going through the basic/foundational material, to then come back to it after having gone through other sections already with more experience under your belt. At this point you might have more confidence to get to the more advanced material of the section or have gained the background or mindset to understand that content and get more out of it. The spatial repetition as a result is on top of this all an excellent way to slowly but surely mold your grey mass into the desired shape.

In case you are not planning to work on a project anytime soon that requires Async programming. Feel free to skip [that section](/guide/learn-async-rust.md) for the time being should it be the case. For now just know that official Async support in Rust exists and that it has an important place within the Rust ecosystem. You can always come (back) to it at a future point when you do decide or realize that strong foundations in this section can help out.

If you ever feel stuck, or want a guide, teacher or mentor. Feel free to reach out to Glen at [glen@plabayo.tech](mailto:glen@plabayo.tech) to book a 1-on-1 session or a workshop for your organization. It can be a one time thing or we can meet regularly to help you along the way.

### Appendix VI. More Material

Learning to master a language has a beginning but it doesn't have an ending. You'll want to continue to learn, teach others and keep up to date. In this appendix you'll find material to help you with all this and more.

#### Keep up to date

Official Blogs:

- [The Rust Programming Language Blog](https://blog.rust-lang.org/)
  - e.g. in October of 2022 GAT's (Generic Associated Types) were finally stabilised, after 6+ years of work: [Generic associated types to be stable in Rust 1.65 — Rust Blog](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/10/28/gats-stabilization.html)
  - [The "Inside Rust" Blog](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/index.html)

Conferences:

- RustConf#2022: <https://rustconf.tilde.io/courses/enrolled/1857336>

Podcasts:

- Rustacean Station is a pretty great podcast with very interesting guests and even more interesting knowledge to share. Listen to it, you won't regret: <https://rustacean-station.org/>
- In order to learn Rust you can also listen to the New Rustacean podcast, which is a podcast about learning Rust: <https://newrustacean.com/>
  - It no longer airs, but its content remains useful and available

Actuality:

- ["This week in Rust"](https://this-week-in-rust.org/) is a weekly newsletter helping you stay up to date with Rust from the lazy comfort of your Mailbox. Easy. They can also be read online in case you prefer a browser instead or do not want to subscribe for w/e reason.
  - Blog articles from the community get shared here as well, some accessible to new comers to Rust, others a bit more advanced
  - They also share VOD's of recent conferences, e.g. the issue in which they share the rust talks from [FOSDEM 2023: This Week in Rust 481  · This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2023/02/08/this-week-in-rust-481/)
- ["Rust Magazine"](https://rustmagazine.org/): an online magazine dedicated to Rust

#### Lists

community curated crate lists:

- [Crate List - Blessed.rs](https://blessed.rs/crates)

#### Read

Free Rust Resources that we haven't mentioned yet, but are great to read at one point or another:

- The Rust Performance Book: <https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/>
- Rust Fuzz Book (Fuzz Testing): <https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/>
- Idiomatic solutions to common programming tasks: <https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/>
- The little book of Rust books: [Unofficial Rust Books - The Little Book of Rust Books](https://lborb.github.io/book/unofficial.html) (which we also already linked in an earlier section)

If you learn by doing and haven't gotten enough from the resources we linked already in "Learn more Rust", here are some more tips:

- Implement a Redis client and server using Tokio, a very well documented and excellent guide on how to write Asynchronous code in Rust: <https://github.com/tokio-rs/mini-redis/> - for learning purposes only 
- If you want to improve your borrowing and reference skills, implementing a Linked List data structure might be for you: <https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/>
- Or perhaps you want to write your own OS in Rust: <https://os.phil-opp.com/>

A blog you might want to RSS subscribe to is Amos's his blog which is always fun to read, be it sometimes a bit heavy: <https://fasterthanli.me/tags/rust/> 

A nice reference sheet if you need one can be found at: <https://cheats.rs/>

#### Educational

- Crust of Rust video series by "Jon Gjengset", for those that want to see an experienced Rust Developer work through problems: [Crust of Rust](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa)
  - You can combine it while learning a bit about networking and implement TCP in Rust yourself: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFivDY3iKAQk3_VAm8SXwt1X>
- If you like to learn by watching you can find a Rust streaming list at <https://github.com/jamesmunns/awesome-rust-streaming/>
- Interesting youtube channel with a lot of great stuff to learn about Rust: <https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate>
- If any of the basic (textual) learning resources from the actual learning journey didn't quite work for you, you might find a video course more useful. If so, here are two of them:
  - [Ultimate Rust Crash Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/) 
  - [Ultimate Rust 2: Intermediate Concepts](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-2/)
- If you need inspiration on things you can build with Rust to get the language in your fingers as well as learn how software that you use is implemented, you might want to check out: <https://app.codecrafters.io/tracks/rust>
- Learn Full Stack Rust Interactively: [Rust Insight! - an interactive book for practicing Rust on the laptop](https://rustinsight.com/) (early access)
- A big index of many more learning resources, named aptly "How to learn Modern Rust — A Guide to the adventurer": <https://github.com/joaocarvalhoopen/How_to_learn_modern_Rust>
  - Do not take the list as-is and use mostly as inspiration. No need to really do all on that list, but if you need more learning resources, there is plenty of good content and inspiration in there!
- Black Hat Rust book: <https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust> (could be nice for inspiration on some hands-on experience while becoming more familiar with Rust)
- If you want to test your Rust concept skills you might also enjoy taking [the Rust Quiz](https://dtolnay.github.io/rust-quiz/). The more answers you have wrong the better, as it means you'll learn new things from the explanation :)
- If you want to learn by doing by contributing to an existing Rust OSS project (including the Rust language and tooling) you can try to find a mentor to help you for free online in achieving this, by going to Awesome Rust Mentors: <https://rustbeginners.github.io/awesome-rust-mentors/>

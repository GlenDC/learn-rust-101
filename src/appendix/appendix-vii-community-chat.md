### Appendix VII. Community Chat

Learning from and working with a community is one of the many perks of Rust, which is rightfully known for its warm, inclusive and charming community. Always open and friendly to others.

Here are some chat servers you can join to interact with this fantastic community. All of them are great places to meet other Rust developers, find help, share news or a project and also to give back to the community yourself:

- Discord chat server for the Tokio ecosystem and its community: <https://discord.com/invite/tokio>;
- Discord chat server for the Rust community in general (has a great channel for beginners to find help, and in a very fast manner): <https://discord.com/invite/rust-lang>;
- zulip chat server for Rust, great for core work and advanced purposes: <https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/>.

There are others of course but these are the ones which are both active, inclusive, friendly and known to the authors of this guide as being a great place to be and be part of.

# Contributing

Contributions are accepted and can be done by
making a PR directly or by first opening an issue.

Note however that this guide is on purpose a bit biased
and is not meant to be a wikipedia of all resources out there.
More specifically it is meant to help me and others to introduce
Rust to individuals and companies and help them become Rustaceans,
who are also open to learn and use advanced concepts.

That said, any contribution is welcome and will be reviewed.
